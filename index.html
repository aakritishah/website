      <h2>Home</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to my portfolio! Hi, my name is Aakriti and I am a current computer science Master's student at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering. I have a
        Bachelor's Degree in <b>Computer Science and Business Management</b> and a passion for topics like
        <b>Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Natural Language Processing</b>. I have worked on projects
        involving technologies like deep learning and have research experience from an NSF internship focused on adversarial
        machine learning. My passion lies in using technology for social good and am drawn to leveraging my skills to
        cultivate a better society.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated in December of 2023 with honors from Rollins College (Winter Park, FL) with
        my Bachelor's degree,
        double majoring in Computer Science and Business Management. Through courses like Data Structures and
        Algorithms, Database Design, and Software Engineering, I gained in-depth knowledge of coding languages like
        Python, Java, C, and Assembly, as well as frameworks like TensorFlow, pandas, and Flask. My interdisciplinary
        studies allowed me to boost my technical skills while building creativity and time management from my
        business background.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently a <b>Master's student at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering</b>.

            <strong>'voteSmarter': All-Inclusive Voting Information Mobile App</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Although this application's name sounds a lot like its predecessor, it is way more capable. I developed to be a step above 'voteSmart': easier to navigate, more practical to use, and better UI.
                This mobile app's goal is to educate the user on 6 main things about voting: when and where to vote, who are the candidates running, what are the candidate's stances, registration timelines, and ballot information. I really loved building this because it allowed me to build my skills
                with Android and iOS development, as well as explore several built-in Dart functionalities.</li>

            <strong>‘ASLearning’: Sign Language Translation App</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>This group project was created to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals
                and English speakers. It utilizes TensorFlow, Flutter, and Firebase to develop a mobile app that
                implements deep learning and image recognition to facilitate communication. The goal is to create an
                accessible and inclusive tool for those with hearing impairments to more easily understand English
                speech. This was such an enjoyable project to work on because it allowed me to gain skills in machine
                learning, while simultaneously creating technology that has a meaningful social impact.

                connect with political candidates that appropriately fit their personal views. The user takes a
                political alignment quiz that places them on the political scale. From here the user is provided with
                information about the political candidates in their area, with emphasis on the candidates that their
                views align with. I enjoyed building this application because it allowed me to further improve my skills
                with Python and SQL, as well as explore the Flask framework.</li>

            <strong>Adversarial Machine Learning in Autonomous Vehicles</strong>

              <li>From the summer of 2023, this National Science Foundation-sponsored research focused on evaluating the
                robustness of autonomous vehicle systems against adversarial machine learning attacks. I experimented
                with and simulated various models to determine how to enhance the systems, feedback mechanisms, and
                interfaces between vehicles and human drivers. Working under an NSF grant also provided me with an incredibly valuable

            <strong>Evaluating AI Sentiment Analysis</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>My honors thesis project (poster and paper), started in January of 2023, leverages large language
                models to enhance the sentiment analysis of textual data. By manually coding interview phrases from the
                nonprofit organization Crave, my research group and I formed a foundation for the comparative analysis
                against outputs from different AI models. This allowed us to evaluate the specific sentiment analysis
                capabilities of various natural language processing systems, while also gaining valuable insights about
                Crave that could be used to help their organization. This project aligns with my interests in data, LLMs,
                and NLP, all while cultivating and using data responsibly.</li>
